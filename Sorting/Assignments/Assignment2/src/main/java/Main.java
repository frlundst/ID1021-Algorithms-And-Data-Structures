 * Task: Basis for assignments 1 and 2: Implement insertionsort. Augment the 
 * sorting process so that all the content of the array that is being sorted is 
 * printed after each inner loop iteration. Write a unit test in main() which 
 * allows the user to define the size of the input (N) and then input (N) 
 * integers from stdin which is to be sorted. Add a method which counts the 
 * number of inversions in the input array and prints a list of all inversions 
 * on the format [i,a[i]], [j, a[j]] where i and j are indices and a[i], a[j] 
 * are the values of the elements. Call the method from main() before the array 
 * is sorted. Calculate the time complexity for the algorithm.
